IMPORTANT: Add Your Founder Photo Here

1. Save your founder photo (the one you shared with laptop and microphone)
2. Rename it to: founder.jpg
3. Place it in this folder: public/founder.jpg

The website is already configured to load it from /founder.jpg

Your photo will appear in the "Meet the Founder" section automatically once you add it.
