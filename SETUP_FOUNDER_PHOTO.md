# Setup Founder Photo

## Quick Setup

You provided a founder photo in our conversation. To use it:

1. **Save the photo you shared** (the one showing you with a laptop and microphone)
2. **Rename it to**: `founder.jpg`
3. **Place it in**: `src/assets/founder.jpg`

## Alternative: Use a Different Photo

If you want to use a different photo instead:

1. Choose a high-quality portrait photo (4:5 aspect ratio recommended)
2. Save it as `founder.jpg` in `src/assets/`
3. Follow the guidelines in `src/assets/FOUNDER_PHOTO_INSTRUCTIONS.md`

## Photo Style
The photo should convey:
- Professional builder aesthetic
- Confident but approachable
- Clean, well-lit
- Not overly casual or influencer-style

## Current Implementation
The FounderSection component is already configured and will:
- Display your photo with a subtle glow effect
- Show a gradient placeholder if the photo is missing
- Apply professional styling (rounded corners, soft lighting effect)
- Animate smoothly on scroll

## What's Already Done
✅ FounderSection component created
✅ Premium animations and interactions
✅ Responsive design (mobile + desktop)
✅ Integrated into the main page (after Hero section)
✅ Graceful fallback if photo is missing

## What You Need to Do
📸 Add your photo as `src/assets/founder.jpg`
