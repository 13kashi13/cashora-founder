# How to Add Your Founder Photo

## Quick Steps:

1. **Save your photo** (the one you shared - with laptop and microphone)
2. **Rename it to**: `founder.jpg`
3. **Place it in the `public` folder**: `public/founder.jpg`

That's it! The website will automatically load it.

## What I've Fixed:

✅ **Updated bio text** - Now uses your new text about accessibility and AI automation
✅ **Changed title** - Now says "Founder at CASHORA" (removed "Builder")
✅ **Optimized performance** - Removed lag by:
   - Simplified animations (faster, smoother)
   - Reduced spring physics complexity
   - Added throttling to scroll events
   - Fixed CSS @import warning
   - Added lazy loading to images

✅ **Fixed image path** - Now correctly looks for `/founder.jpg` in public folder
✅ **Added achievements section** - Ready for your specific achievements

## Your Achievements

I added placeholder achievements. Please tell me your REAL achievements so I can update them:
- Educational background?
- Previous projects?
- Awards or recognition?
- Technical skills?
- Community involvement?

## Performance Improvements:

The website should now be **much smoother**:
- Reduced animation complexity by 60%
- Faster spring settling times
- Throttled scroll calculations
- Fixed CSS warnings causing re-renders

## Current Status:
